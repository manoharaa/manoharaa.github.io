Engineer with 9 years in IT, it was little difficult to switch/learn something new while working on cutting edge technologies like Ruby, Rails and AngularJS. But as Steve Jobs said never settle till you find it and then I guess this is what I want to be.. “Data Scientist”

The term scientist itself is pretty interesting to me and with big data field it becomes more sexy. It’s been around 3 years I was wondering what is big data and how I can learn this stuff. Finally I enrolled into [S P Jain](http://www.spjain.org/index.aspx) for their [BDAP](http://www.spjain.org/big-data/index.aspx) first batch in [Oct’15](http://www.spjain.org/big-data/index.aspx) as learning online wasn’t so successful for me. 

What is data scientist ?

Data scientist is person who is good at programming, algorithms, maths & stats and good at using domain knowledge wisely over the data to envision products, make decisions using technology. 

In short, Beginner Data Scientist = Programmer (Data Engineer) + Statistician (Data Analyst)

How to become Data Scientist ?
